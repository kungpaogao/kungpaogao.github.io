question: is it possible to trick the mind into saying things unconsciously?

overall concept: have a list of simple tasks/questions, a timer, and some distraction (perhaps an incentive to finish questions).

applications: getting simple secrets.

possible test case:

requirements: timer must be visible, distraction must be focused on, speak fast enough to keep flow/slow enough to extend time.
revision: run 2 or 3 sets of questions w/ only one set containing the key.

time: 60s/set
distraction: a piece of paper with random letters (puzzle, maze, swirly pattern, etc)
tasks/questions: 3*12
"please keep your eyes on the paper and the timer"

A
1. what color is the sky
2. what is 3/3
3. who is the president
4. what color is a stop sign
5. how many family members do you have
6. hold up your right hand
7. how much time is left on the timer
8. what town are we in
9. what color is your hair
10. what is your last name
11. when is christmas
12. who is the principal

B
1. what is your first name
2. what phone do you own
3. what town are we in
4. what school do you go to
5. hold up your left hand

7. what is 3*2
8. who is the first lady
9. who is the teacher of your 5th period class
10. who is your crush
11. what is your favorite color
12. what is my name

problems: subject may think fast enough, placement of the question, nature of the questions, nature of the distraction
